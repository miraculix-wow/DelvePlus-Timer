### DelvePlus-Timer ###

Just `/delve` and you see the options available.

`/delve start` starts a 10 second timer for preparing and then the DelvePlus Timer begins the official Time.

`/delve stop` stopps the current Timer. On v1.0 you have to stop it manually for your Time. This will be improved in further Releases.

With `/delve show` and `/delve hide`Â  you can show or hide the Timer

`/delve lock` or `/delve unlock` you can drag the timer around
